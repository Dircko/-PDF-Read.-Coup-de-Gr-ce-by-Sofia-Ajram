Danielewski and Susanna Clarke.Vicken has a plan: throw himself into the Saint Lawrence River in Montreal and end it all for good, believing it to be the only way out for him after a lifetime of depression and pain. But, stepping off the subway, he finds himself in an endless, looping station.Determined to find a way out again, he starts to explore the rooms and corridors ahead of him. But no matter how many claustrophobic hallways or vast cathedral-esque rooms he passes through, the exit is nowhere in sight.The more he explores his strange new prison, the more he becomes convinced that he hasn?t been trapped there accidentally, and amongst the shadows and concrete, he comes to realise that he almost certainly is not alone.A terrifying psychological nightmare from a powerful new voice in horror.</p>
